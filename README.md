This project aims to train a bot to excel in the Frozen Lake game using Reinforcement Learning. Leveraging a Q-Learning algorithm within the OpenAI Gym environment, we employed the epsilon-greedy strategy to balance exploration and exploitation during training. The bot demonstrated remarkable proficiency by achieving a 95% winning accuracy, showcasing its capability to master the Frozen Lake game. Check out the project link for more details on the implementation and outcomes.
